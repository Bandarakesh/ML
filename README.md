**ML REPO**\
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models from scratch and experiments with fine-tuning them using real-world datasets.
It's a hands-on practice space to deepen understanding of core ML principles and optimization techniques.

Logistic Regression (from scratch)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Trees

Neural Networks (2-layer, DNNs, CNNs)

Model Fine-Tuning (with sklearn/TensorFlow)
